# Flower Classifier Created By Alex Godfrey 11/15/2020

## Background
This project was originally created in order to satisfy a project requirement for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Program, and later expanded to increase accuracy and let users test their own images.

## Installation
Download flower-classify.py, flower-compatibility.txt, test-images folder, and desired test images from google.

## Neural Network Information
There are currently three models available to choose from. (4) is a model trained on 1 dense layer neural network with 102 outputs over four epochs, and the same for (6) six epoch and (8) eight epoch networks
The models have accuracies of 73%, 76%, and 77%, respectively

## Usage
1. Run flower-classify.py
2. Enter the path for the image you want to test (e.g. images/wild_pansy.jpg)
3. Enter which neural network you would like to use (4, 6, or 8) epoch nets are available (e.g. 4)
4. Enter the number of top predictions you would like to see (max 102) (e.g. 5)
5. Wait for calculations to complete to see results!
